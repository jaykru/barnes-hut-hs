# Barnes-Hut-hs
In this repository is an implementation in Haskell of the Barnes-Hut
[algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation) for
n-body gravitation simulation. Currently the algorithm computes n-body
gravitation forces but rendering the results (with SDL2) is WIP. There are
future plans to parallelize it using the Accelerate eDSL for CUDA.
